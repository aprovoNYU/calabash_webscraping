# Calabash Metadata Webscraping Project

## Intro
*Calabash: a journal of Caribbean arts and letters* was an open access journal published from 2000-2008 by New York University's Graduate Program in Spanish & Portuguese Languages & Literatures. As part of a project to migrate the site to the Faculty Digital Archive, NYU Libraries' institutional repository, the journal's website will be scraped to produce preliminary metadata for each article.

## Spiders
This repository contains three spiders created using [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html). 

1. **vol1no1**: misleadingly named, since it actually works for volumes 1-3
2. **vol4**: works for volumes 4 and 5
3. **contributors**: scrapes author names and bios from the contributor indexes
